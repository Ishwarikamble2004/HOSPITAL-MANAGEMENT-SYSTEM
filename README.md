### Hello, I'm Ishwari Kamble 

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## Projects

### Hospital Management System

#User Authentication:
Prompts the user for a username and password.
Verifies credentials against stored user data.
Grants access based on the user role (admin/doctor).

#Main Menu:
Displays options for different management tasks:
Add User
Patient Registration
Pharmacy Management
Appointments
Patient Management
Billing And Payment
Exit

#Menu Operations:
Depending on the user’s choice, calls the corresponding functions to perform tasks like adding users, registering patients, managing pharmacy management, handling appointments, managing patient information, and processing billing and payments.

#Data Management:
Loads and saves data such as user information, patients, medicines, and invoices from/to files.

#Technical Stack: 
Languages: C++
Algorithms:Sorting and searching,KMP,linear search,priority queue,Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Tools: File-based Storage,Credential Management

## Impact:
Improved Efficiency:Automates and simplifies routine tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and billing.Reduces the time healthcare professionals spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on patient care.
Enhanced Data Management:Provides a centralized repository for storing and accessing patient records, medicine inventories, and invoices.Ensures accuracy and consistency in maintaining patient and hospital data, reducing errors and mismanagement.
Better Patient Care:Facilitates prompt services through efficient appointment and patient management.Makes it easier for healthcare providers to access patient histories and treatment records, leading to informed and timely medical decisions.
Security and Privacy:Enhances security by restricting access to sensitive information through user authentication and role-based access.
Cost-Effective:Minimizes paperwork and manual record-keeping, leading to lower operational costs.Optimizes resource utilization, reducing wastage and enhancing overall hospital efficiency.
Patient Satisfaction:Provides a smoother and more efficient experience for patients, leading to higher satisfaction levels.Improves transparency in billing and services, fostering trust and reliability.
By implementing such a system, hospitals can achieve higher efficiency, better patient care, and more robust data management, ultimately contributing to the overall improvement of healthcare services.
