Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## Projects

### Hospital Management System

OVERVIEW: The Hospital Management System is designed to address key challenges in the healthcare industry, including patient data management, appointment scheduling, billing, and resource allocation. By implementing a centralized digital platform, it streamlines operations, enhances patient care, and ensures efficient communication across departments. This solution aims to create a seamless, efficient, and patient-centered healthcare environment.

#Technical Stack: 
Languages: C++
Algorithms:Sorting and searching,KMP,linear search,priority queue,Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Tools: Design And Analysis of Algorithm

## Impact:
1. Improved Efficiency:
   Automates and simplifies routine tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and billing.Reduces the time healthcare professionals spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on 
   patient care.
2. Enhanced Data Management:
   Provides a centralized repository for storing and accessing patient records, medicine inventories, and invoices.Ensures accuracy and consistency in maintaining patient and hospital data, reducing errors and 
   mismanagement.
3. Better Patient Care:
   Facilitates prompt services through efficient appointment and patient management.Makes it easier for healthcare providers to access patient histories and treatment records, leading to informed and timely 
   medical decisions.
4. Security and Privacy:
   Enhances security by restricting access to sensitive information through user authentication and role-based access.
   Cost-Effective:Minimizes paperwork and manual record-keeping, leading to lower operational costs.Optimizes resource utilization, reducing wastage and enhancing overall hospital efficiency.
5. Patient Satisfaction:
    Provides a smoother and more efficient experience for patients, leading to higher satisfaction levels.Improves transparency in billing and services, fostering trust and reliability.
   
By implementing such a system, hospitals can achieve higher efficiency, better patient care, and more robust data management, ultimately contributing to the overall improvement of healthcare services.
